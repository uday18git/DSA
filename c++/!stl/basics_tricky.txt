An array and a linked list are both fundamental data structures used in computer science for organizing and storing data. They differ in their structure and the way they store and access elements.

1. Array:
   - An array is a sequential collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Elements in an array are accessed using an index. The index indicates the position of an element in the array.
   - Arrays have a fixed size, meaning that once they are created, their size cannot be changed.

2. Linked List:
   - A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements called nodes, where each node contains both data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
   - Unlike arrays, elements in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink in size during program execution, as memory is allocated or deallocated as needed.
Now, let's discuss when arrays may fail and why linked lists are required:

Arrays have some limitations:

1.Fixed Size: As mentioned earlier, arrays have a fixed size, meaning that you have to specify the size of the array when you declare it. If you need more space than the allocated size, you may run out of space, leading to overflow, or you may end up wasting memory if the allocated size is larger than what you need.
2. Insertion and Deletion: Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an array requires shifting all the elements after the insertion or deletion point, which can be inefficient, especially for large arrays.
Linked lists, on the other hand, overcome these limitations:
1. Dynamic Size: Linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are added or removed. Since memory allocation is done dynamically, you don't need to specify the size upfront.
2. Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations in a linked list can be performed efficiently without the need to shift elements. For example, inserting a new element into a linked list involves updating pointers, which is a constant-time operation.
Let's illustrate this with an example:
Suppose you have a list of tasks to do, and you want to represent them using a data structure. Initially, you have three tasks:
1. Task A
2. Task B
3. Task C
If you use an array to store these tasks and later want to insert a new task (Task D) between Task B and Task C, you would need to shift Task C and any subsequent tasks one position to the right to make space for Task D. This shifting operation can be inefficient, especially if the array is large.
However, if you use a linked list, you can simply create a new node for Task D and update the pointers to insert it between Task B and Task C. This operation can be done efficiently without the need to shift other elements.
Therefore, linked lists are suitable when you need a dynamic data structure that supports efficient insertion and deletion operations, whereas arrays are more appropriate when you have a fixed-size collection or when random access to elements is required.
