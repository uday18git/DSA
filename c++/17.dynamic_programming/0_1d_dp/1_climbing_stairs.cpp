// distinct ways to reach a nth step if we start from 0th step and can take 1 or 2 steps at a time
// how to understand that this is dp problem
// count the total number of ways or which is giving minimal and maximum output
// try all possible ways , best or count , thts when u try to apply recursion , all possible ways
// first think it is a recursive problem then dp
// try to represent the problem in terms of index
// do all possible stuffs on that index according tht problem
// sum of all stuffs -> count all ways
// find min -> take min of all stuff and same for max
// 0 1 2 3 4 5  ... ... n
