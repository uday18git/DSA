// components of a graph
// nodes->These are the states or vertex. 
// edges -> Links between states in a graph 
// two types -> undirected->one way edges(->) and directed -> two way edges(<->)
// Adjacency matrix and Adjacency List
// Adjacency matrix -> 2d array of size n*n where n is number of nodes
// Adjacency list -> array of size n where n is number of nodes
// dfs ->stack
// bfs ->queue
// dfs has 3 states -> preorder, inorder, postorder
// preorder->first time when call comes on the node
// inorder->when call works inside subtree
// postorder->when call comes back to the node, after this call wont come on the same node
// bfs -> level order traversal
// bfs if node is visited then all the nodes attached with it are added to the queue, after moving to next node its elements are also added to the queue
// different properties of components of a graph
// weighted nodes - values are associated with nodes
// weighted edges - values are associated with edges
