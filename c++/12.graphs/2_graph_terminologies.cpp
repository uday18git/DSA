// directed graph -> graph with directed edges
// undirected graph -> graph with undirected edges
// degree of a vertex 
// in degree -> number of incoming edges to a node
// out degree -> number of outgoing edges from a node
// Path between two vertices -> All vertices which come in the path of two given vertices is called their path
// connected graph -> each node has path from every other node
// disconnected graph -> each node doesnt have path from every other node
// connected components -> each connected graph in a disconnected graph is called a connected component
// cycle -> path from a node to itself in a graph is known as a cycle
// cyclic and acyclic graphs -> cyclic graph has cycle and acyclic graph doesnt have cycle
// tree -> tree is a connected acyclic graph
// properties of tree
// 1.number of edges = number of nodes -1
// 2. number of connected components = 1
// 3. number of cycles = 0
// Each node has path from every other node bcos it is connnected
// Directed acyclic graph -> directed graph with no cycle
// complete graph -> A graph in which each node is connected to every other node by direct edge is called a complete graph
// number of edges in a complete graph = n*(n-1)/2
// Weighted graph -> A graph in which each edge has a weight associated with it is called a weighted graph
